# This is Shopping Website created by me(Amit Kumar)
Most of the Functionality has been included which are required in our daily life during online purchasing
This Project is Fully Responsive 

in the backend part I have used django 


in the frontend part I have used Reactjs

# For the authentiction part I have used JWT 
# I have provided online as well as offline(Cash on Delivery) method for payment
# For the global state management I have used Redux
# To update the status of either product has been delivered admin can mark as delivered
# there is also a business rule applied like if the product price is less than 100 then shipping price will be applied
# customer can research for different product based on the choice and the price range
# Admin can delete ,edit user or product and can also add product through userscreen and the admin facility will only be shown when user is admin

## For styling React bootsrap as well as css is used

# This website is still under construction as I want to add some more features
